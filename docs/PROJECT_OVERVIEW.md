> **Last Updated:** 2026-06-21 | **Version:** 1.0.0 | **AI-Maintained**

## What Is This Project?

**City Halal Market** (internal project name: HalalMart) is a full-featured grocery & e-commerce backend API built with **Node.js**, **TypeScript**, **Express**, and **Prisma ORM** on a **MySQL** database. It powers an online storefront where customers can browse products, manage carts, place orders, and track deliveries — and where admins can manage the entire catalog, inventory, orders, and even the visual layout of the storefront.

The project name in `package.json` is `halalmart-backend`.

## Business Problem Solved

HalalMart enables small-to-medium grocery and lifestyle e-commerce businesses in Bangladesh to:

1. **Sell online** — product catalog, categories, brands, promotions, and variant-based pricing.
2. **Accept orders** — COD, card, bKash, Nagad payment methods.
3. **Manage deliveries** — hierarchical location system (State → City → Area) with configurable delivery charges per zone.
4. **Retain customers** — OTP-based phone authentication, reward points, wallet credits, wishlists.
5. **Run marketing campaigns** — Facebook Conversions API integration, coupons, bulk promotions.
6. **Control storefront layout** — a builder system that lets admins visually compose page layouts by section without writing code.
7. **Import products from WooCommerce** — migrate an existing WooCommerce store's catalog into HalalMart automatically.

## Key Design Patterns

1. **Controller-Service separation** — controllers handle HTTP, services handle business logic
2. **`asyncHandler` wrapper** — all async controllers are wrapped to avoid boilerplate try/catch
3. **Custom `ApiError` hierarchy** — typed error classes propagate to a centralized `errorHandler` middleware
4. **Zod validators** — input schemas validated by middleware before controllers run
5. **Prisma transactions** — complex multi-table writes use `prisma.$transaction()` to ensure atomicity
6. **Builder versioning** — every save creates a new immutable `BuilderPageVersion`; publish promotes a draft
